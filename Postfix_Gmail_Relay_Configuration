Postfix Gamil Relay configuration.

Postfix: Postfix is a free and open-source mail transfer agent (MTA) that routes and delivers electronic mail.
Postfix is a flexible mail server that is available on most Linux distribution. Though a full feature mail server, Postfix can also be used as a simple relay host to another mail server, or smart host.
You can configure your MTA to relay outgoing mail through Gmail. This gives you the benefit of Gmail's reliability and robust infrastructure, and provides you with a simple means of sending email from the command line.


Installation and configuration steps.


1: Install postfix package.
#yum install postfix cyrus-sasl-plain mailx



2: Restart and enable the postfix service.
#systemctl restart postfix
#systemctl enable postfix



3: Configure postfix. Add below mentioned lines.
#vim /etc/postfix/main.cf


myhostname = abc.xyz.com
relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
smtp_use_tls = yes
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous


Note: The myhostname parameter is optional. If the hostname is not specified, Postfix will use the fully-qualified domain name of the Linux server.



4: Provide gmail credentials . "/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd"

#vim /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
[smtp.gmail.com]:587 username:password

Note: Replace username and password with your gmail account username and password.



5: Process Password File.
Use postmap to compile and hash the contents of sasl_passwd. The results will be stored in your Postfix configuration directory in the file sasl_passwd.db.

#postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
#chown root:postfix /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd*
#chmod 640 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd*



6: Reload the Postfix configuration. 
#systemctl restart postfix




7: Test the Relay.
#mail -s "Subjet of the mail"  abc@zyz.com



8: Troubleshooting
The maillog can be reviewed if the test message is not successfully delivered.

#tail -f /var/log/maillog
