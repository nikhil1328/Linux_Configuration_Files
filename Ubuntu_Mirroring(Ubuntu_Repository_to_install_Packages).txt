UBUNTU_MIRRORING (REPOSITORY_Creation_to_install_Packages_in_Ubuntu)

We can setup a local repository of Ubuntu in our local PC or server using many tools, but we'll featuring about APT-Mirror. Here, 
we'll be mirroring packages from the default mirror to our Local Server or PC and we'll need at least 120 GB or more free space in 
our local or external hard drive. It can be configured through a HTTP or FTP server to share its software packages with local system 
clients.
We'll need to install Apache Web Server and APT-Mirror to get our stuffs working out of the box. Here are the steps below to 
configure a working local repository:


1.	Installing Required Packages.
We'll first install a web server to host our local repository. And then we'll need to install apt-mirror. 
$ sudo apt-get install apache2
$ sudo apt-get install apt-mirror


2.	Configuring APT-Mirror.
Now create a directory to save all packages. For example, let us create a directory called  “/packages”. We are going to save all 

packages in this directory:
$ sudo mkdir /packages

Now, open the file /etc/apt/mirror.list file
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/mirror.list

Copy the below lines of configuration to mirror.list and edit as per requirements.

############# config ##################
set base_path    /packages
# set mirror_path  $base_path/mirror
# set skel_path    $base_path/skel
# set var_path     $base_path/var
# set cleanscript $var_path/clean.sh
# set defaultarch  <running host architecture>
# set postmirror_script $var_path/postmirror.sh
# set run_postmirror 0
set nthreads     20
set _tilde 0
#
############# end config ##############

deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-updates main restricted universe multiverse
#deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-proposed main restricted universe multiverse
#deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-backports main restricted universe multiverse

deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-updates main restricted universe multiverse
#deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-proposed main restricted universe multiverse
#deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-backports main restricted universe multiverse
clean http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu


Note:  If you use both 32bit and 64bit architectures, you should name them separately in the above file. For example, if you use 
32bit architecture, the lines should start with deb-i386and for 64bit, the lines should start as deb-amd64.
Now, we'll have to run apt-mirror which will now get/mirror all the packages in the repository.

$sudo apt-mirror

It will take time to download all the packages from the Ubuntu Server which depends upon the connection speed and performance with 
respect to you and the mirror server.


3.	Configuring Web Server.
To be able to access the repo from other computers you need a webserver. So, we will now configure Apache Server:
We will create a symlink from our local repo's directory to a directory ubuntu in the hosting directory of Apache ie 

“/var/www/ubuntu” .

$ sudo ln -s /packages /var/www/ubuntu
$ sudo service apache2 start

The above command will allow us to browse our Mirrored Repo from our localhost ie http://127.0.0.1 by default.


4. 	Configuring Client Side to access packages form ubuntu mirror.
Finally, we need to add repository source in other computers which will fetch the packages and repository from our computer. To do 
that, we'll need to edit "/etc/apt/sources.list" and add the following lines.

$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Add this line in /etc/apt/sources.list and save.

deb http://(ip add of server)/ubuntu/ trusty main restricted universe
OR
deb http:// (ip add of server)/ubuntu trusty universe
deb http:// (ip add of server)/ubuntu trusty main restricted
deb http:// (ip add of server)/ubuntu trusty-updates main restricted


$ sudo apt-get update

Finally, we are done. Now you can install the required packages using sudo apt-get install packagename from your local Ubuntu 
repository with high speed and with low bandwidth.
